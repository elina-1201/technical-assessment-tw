# Technical Assessment

This project is a technical assessment for a Front-End Internship position.

The original HTML file was provided by the company and is not included in this repository, as it is not my original work. A placeholder HTML file has been created for demonstration purposes. 

The task was to implement a video player using JavaScript within a single file, `video-template.js`. No other files were to be added or modified.


## Given instructions:

- Create a video player which will display a commercial (preroll) at the beginning.

- It needs to be created entirely by pure JavaScript.
Example: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_video.asp (var x =
document.createElement(“VIDEO”);)

- Player should be floating (be sticky on scroll).

- Adding a commercial on a video player should be done by using Google IMA SDK
library: https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/client-side/get-started

- Final result should be similar to the player on this page: https://formats.techwave.io/test/outstream/index.html

## Skills Applied and Knowledge Gained:

- Navigated and utilized library documentation effectively
- Developed features by referencing provided website examples
- Practiced debugging techniques
- Worked with a library's API and its components
- Manipulated DOM elements using vanilla JavaScript
- Solved problems creatively, such as adding skip-ad functionality via URL parameters and implementing a custom mute/unmute button manually
